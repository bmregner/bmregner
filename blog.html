        <h2>Insights for All</h2>
<p>
As an Insight Fellow in the Summer session of 2016 I worked as a consultant
with a local start-up. They are business-to-business company that provides a platform to
track user events on an app or website and deploy targetted messaging to users
based on those events. Messages can be sent at both specific times or through
event triggers and can be delivered through emails, mobile push notifications
and SMS. 
</p>
<p>
My partner company has a variety of clients, some of which have not yet started
to build a data team. The problem I solved for them is to provide
these clients with actionable insights that don't require deep statistical
knowledge or the interpretation of a complicated figure or chart. To that end,
I built a pipeline that performs analysis on user events and timestamps to
produce clear, textual insights that can be readily acted upon.
</p>
<p>
As an example, let's look at a fictionalized version of my partner's many
clients. "Ben's Bread" is a new app through which you can order freshly baked
loaves of bread delivered directly to customers in the Valley. To be explicitly
clear, the data shown below is real data from a client, but in
order to protect client identity, the names of events have been changed and the
timestamps have been shifted in time.
</p>
<p>
When a client sits down to set up a new messaging campaign, one
of the first questions they might ask is how maximize the bread and butter action for 
their app. In the case of "Ben's Bread", this action is <b>Buy Bread</b> and
corresponds to a user putting in an order for a bread delivery. Using a random
forest classifier as implemented in the Python package scikit-learn, good
discrimination can be made between users, with an area under the ROC curve of
0.97.
</p>
<p><img width="90%" src="./resources/bensbread_roc.png"></p>

<p>
However, a ROC curve is not necessarily an easy concept to explain.
Instead of providing this chart, I return to the client a textual response with
a straightforward description:
</p>

<blockquote> A statistical tool called a random forest classifier is able to
    discriminate customers who will <b>Buy Bread</b> from users who will not with 92.6%
    accuracy. </blockquote>

<p>
An advantage of using a random forest classifier is that feature importance is
readily computed. The top 5 most important events are reported to the client:
</p>

<blockquote> The events that are the most important to discriminate users are:
    <ul style="list-style: none";>
        <li> <b>Add Loaf</b> </li>
        <li> <b>Remove Loaf</b> </li>
        <li> <b>View Daily Bread</b> </li>
        <li> <b>Doughy Details</b> </li>
        <li> <b>Filter Ingredients</b> </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

The next step in the pipeline is to quantify the importance of these features.
I compute the conditional probability of a user performing <b>Buy Bread</b> or
not, given the user has performed one of the important features. Taking the ratio 
of these values quantifies the impact of different events on <b>Buy
Bread</b>. For Ben's Bread, the output from this part of the pipeline is:

<blockquote>
Users who...
<ul style="list-style: none";>
    <li> <b>Buy Bread</b> have always done <b>View Daily Bread</b>. </li>
    <li> <b>Doughy Details</b> are...       7.5x more likely to <b>Buy Bread</b>. </li>
<li> <b>Filter Ingredients</b> are...       1.3x less likely to <b>Buy Bread</b>. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
A few interesting insights can be understood from this output. The fact that all
users who <b>Buy Bread</b> have a corresponding <b>View Daily Bread</b> is a
validation that the app is working, since users must pass through this page in
order to make a purchase. Users who look at product details trigger a <b>Doughy
    Details</b> event, and users who have looked at product details are 7.5
times more likely to <b>Buy Bread</b>. This is a useful insight, because it
shows that users who look at the product page are exciteded by what they see and
make a purchase at an increased rate. Because this feature is clearly having a
postivie impact on the user experince, it would be a good feature to focus 
A/B testing on to see if user engagement can be further encouraged.  
</p>

<p>
Perhaps most interestingly, users who <b>Filter Ingredients</b> are actually
less likely to go on and make a purchase. There are a few reasons this may be
the case. One possibility is that users are not finding products they are
interested in, and sending out user surveys to find products users might be
interested might be a good investment. Another possibility is a problem in the
tech stack, perhaps the filtering function isn't working properly or is
returning nonsensical results in certain cases. Doing a deep dive into
understanding this issue would be an actionable insight with high ROI.
</p>

<p>
Another useful insight is the time of day at which users are active. Using
kernel density estimation from scikit-learn, I compute the probability
distribution of daily activity for each event.
<p>

<img width="90%" src="./resources/bensbread_kde.png">

<p>
I use a peak finding algorithm to to determine a few times where users are
maximally active:
</p>

<blockquote>
Users are mostly likely to...
<ul style="list-style: none";>
    <li> <b>Buy Bread</b> at...         7am and 1pm </li>
    <li> <b>Doughy Details</b> at...        8am and 1pm </li>
    <li> <b>Filter Loaves</b> at...     7am and 12pm </li>
</ul>
</blockquote> 

<p> The start-up I partnered with is excited about these results, which are
applicable to all of their many clients. I delivered the pipeline outlined in
this blog post in a Jupyter notebook, and they are currently implementing it
into their user interface.  </p>

<h2>Model Details</h2> <p> The features available for each company are a log of
user ids, event names, and timestamps. The engineered features for
classification are counts of each event type for each user. The key problems in
interpretting this data is that many features will be irrelevant, the
dimensionality may be very high depending on how many a client has defined,
some events will likely be correlated, and most importantly the results of a
classifiction algorithm need to be interpretable. For these reasons, I decided
to use a random forest classifier, which can handle all of these problems well.
